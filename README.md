# Module 2 BONUS workshop

This workshop includes 2 micro-projects:

- Generative art
- Sorting algorithms

⚠️ For both of these projects, there are some additional _very important_ tasks:

### 1. Git it done

Take this opportunity to practice your Git skills!

Specifically, whenever you finish an exercise, create a new commit! If the workshop has 5 exercises, you should have (at least) 5 commits.

### 2. Blog about it!

(This is optional, but recommended)

The two tasks being given in this project are interesting, for different reasons:

- The first portion, Generative Art, is creative, and every student will have different results. People will be interested to see the art you create, and the steps taken to achieve that result
- The second portion is a _very common Computer Science practice_, something that people always want to learn. It's also a common technical interview question!

This is a prime time to start a technical blog on https://dev.to/.

Write a blog post, either for the generative art or for the sorting algorithms. Share what you did, what you learned, any problems you ran into, and the end result.

If you become a proficient technical writer, all kinds of doors open up. It takes years to get good at it, but it could lead to incredible, lucrative opportunities down the line.

**You don't have to publish what you write.** The goal is to practice technical writing + reinforce what your learning. If you want, you can publish it, but you don't need to if you'd rather not.
